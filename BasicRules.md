# Wingfeather Adventures

## Introduction

Wingfeather Adventures is a Tabletop Role Playing Game set in the world of Aerwiar, the world of Andrew Peterson’s Wingfeather Saga. With the guidance of a Storyteller, players will create characters and take them on an epic journey across the land, and perhaps even Beyond the Edges of Maps. Wingfeather Adventures is created with players new to TTRPGs in mind, with streamlined rules designed to be easy for anyone to pick up.

### What is a Role Playing Game?

A Role Playing Game (abbreviated RPG) is a type of game where players create characters and work together to tell a story with those characters. Generally, each player will create a single character, and design their personality, choose their abilities, and determine how they will act in different situations. One player, usually someone who has more experience with RPGs, will take on the special role of the Game Master or Storyteller. Their job is to guide the other players through the story, as well as creating all the other characters, allies, enemies, and the environment.

### Playing the Game

Playing the game is a lot like playing a game of make-believe, with a bit more structure to make sure things move smoothly and all the players are treated fairly. The game is played over several sessions, allowing time for the story to develop and for characters to find their motivations. As part of the first session, players will create their characters (described in `Creating Your Character`). These characters are called Player Characters. The storyteller will be in charge of all the other characters, called Non-Player Characters, or NPCs.

Gameplay follows the following stages:

1. The Storyteller describes the environment around the characters.
2. The players describe what they want their characters to do.
3. The Storyteller determines what happens as a result and describes it to the players.

The rest of the rules in this book exist to help this gameplay cycle. In many situations, the Storyteller will be able to directly decide what happens, and the cycle will return to the first stage. In some situations, such as crossing a treacherous bridge, sneaking past some slippery Stranders, or attacking a ferocious Fang, the result will be uncertain, so the Storyteller will ask the players to roll dice to determine what the outcome is.

### The Setting of the Game

Wingfeather Adventures takes place in the world of Aerwiar. While you can play the game without reading the books, having the background of the books helps to create an understanding between players of how the world works. Many of the settings the characters will find themselves in could also spoil things for readers who haven’t finished the stories yet.

## Player Characters

A character is how a player interacts with the world. Characters can be created with a wide variety of skills, talents, and personality traits. Newer players may find it easier to create a character with a personality similar to their own, while more experienced players, or players that are more comfortable acting, may want to create a character with an entirely different personality from themselves.

### Your Character Sheet

A Character Sheet is a document that provides all the information about a player's character in the game. It includes details about the character's abilities, skills, attributes, and other important information that the player needs to know in order to play their character.

The character sheet is used as a reference during gameplay to help the player keep track of their character's abilities and progress. It allows players to quickly and easily see what their character is capable of in any given situation.

### Attributes

Attributes are a description of your character’s baseline abilities. Each attribute has a number that describes how talented your character is in that area. Whenever the Storyteller asks you to roll dice to determine an outcome, this number will be added to the value you roll.

The four core attributes and their abbreviations are *Might (MI)*, *Agility (AG)*, *Wit (WI)*, and *Charm (CH)*.

*Might* is a measurement of how strong your character is. A character with more Might will be able to carry more, hit harder when fighting, and endure more.

*Agility* is a measurement of how fast and flexible your character is. A character with more Agility can run faster, climb more easily, and dodge attacks better.

*Wit* is a measurement of your character’s intelligence. A character with more Wit is able to identify plants and animals, is more likely to notice hidden details or traps, and is better at solving puzzles.

*Charm* is a measurement of how well your character understands other people. A character with more Charm is better at inspiring their allies, is more likely to notice when someone is hiding something, and is better at disguising themselves.

### Skills

Each attribute has a set of associated skills. Skills are more specific than attributes, and will only apply in certain situations. Each skill has a proficiency level, which is a measurement of how much your character has practiced that skill.

#### Might Skills

The skills associated with Might are *Carry*, *Demolish*, and *Melee Attack*.

The *Carry* skill is used to move heavy objects, push obstacles out of the way, or carry a wounded ally to safety.

The *Demolish* skill is used to break down barriers, damage vehicles, or collapse a tunnel behind you to secure an escape.

The *Melee Attack* skill is used when fighting up close, using swords, clubs, or fists.

#### Agility Skills

The skills associated with Agility are *Sneak*, *Acrobatics*, and *Ranged Attack*.

The *Sneak* skill is used to move quietly and stealthily without being noticed.

The *Acrobatics* skill is used for climbing, swinging from vines or lines on a ship, and other such feats worthy of the Florid Sword.

The *Ranged Attack* skill is used when fighting with a ranged weapon, such as a bow, a blow-dart, or throwing a dagger.

#### Wit Skills

The skills associated with Wit are *Remember*, *Search*, and *Ponder*.

The *Remember* skill helps your character recall information, either from earlier in their adventure or knowledge they have learned from books.

The *Search* skill is used to find or detect things, such as traps, secret passages, or to find edible food or follow tracks in the wilderness.

The *Ponder* skill is used to think through a puzzle or problem, potentially gaining a hint from the Storyteller.

#### Charm Skills

The skills associated with Charm are *Speak*, *Perform*, and *Befriend*.~~~~
