# Introduction

Wingfeather Adventures is a Tabletop Role Playing Game set in the world of Aerwiar, the world of Andrew Peterson’s Wingfeather Saga. With the guidance of a Storyteller, players will create characters and take them on an epic journey across the land, and perhaps even Beyond the Edges of Maps. Wingfeather Adventures is created with players new to TTRPGs in mind, with streamlined rules designed to be easy for anyone to pick up.

## What is a Role Playing Game?

A Role Playing Game (RPG) is a type of game where players create characters and work together to tell a story with those characters. Generally, each player will create a single character, and design their personality, choose their abilities, and determine how they will act in different situations. One player, usually someone who has more experience with RPGs, will take on the special role of the Game Master or Storyteller. Their job is to guide the other players through the story, as well as creating all the other characters, allies, enemies, and the environment.

## Playing the Game

Playing the game is a lot like playing a game of make-believe, with a bit more structure to make sure things move smoothly and all the players are treated fairly. The game is played over several sessions, allowing time for the story to develop and for characters to find their motivations. As part of the first session, players will create their characters (described in 'Creating Your Character'). These characters are called Player Characters. The storyteller will be in charge of all the other characters, called Non-Player Characters, or NPCs.

Gameplay follows the following stages:

1. The Storyteller describes the environment around the characters.
2. The players describe what they want their characters to do.
3. The Storyteller determines what happens as a result and describes it to the players.

The rest of the rules in this book exist to help this gameplay cycle. In many situations, the Storyteller will be able to directly decide what happens, and the cycle will return to the first stage. In some situations, such as crossing a treacherous bridge, sneaking past some slippery Stranders, or attacking a ferocious Fang, the result will be uncertain, so the Storyteller will ask the players to roll dice to determine what the outcome is.

## The Setting of the Game

Wingfeather Adventures takes place in the world of Aerwiar. While you can play the game without reading the books, having the background of the books helps to create an understanding between players of how the world works. Many of the settings the characters will find themselves in could also spoil things for readers who haven’t finished the stories yet.

# Characters

A character is how a player interacts with the world. Characters can be created with a wide variety of skills, talents, and personality traits. Newer players may find it easier to create a character with a personality similar to their own, while more experienced players, or players that are more comfortable acting, may want to create a character with an entirely different personality from themselves.

To start the step-by-step guide to creating a character, jump to "Creating your Character".

## Your Character Sheet

A Character Sheet is a document that provides a quick reference for all of the information about a player's character. It includes details about the character's abilities, skills, attributes, and other important information that the player needs to know in order to play their character.

The character sheet is used as a reference during gameplay to help the player keep track of their character's abilities and progress. It allows players to quickly and easily see what their character is capable of in any given situation.

## Attributes

Attributes are a description of your character’s baseline abilities. Each attribute has a number that describes how talented your character is in that area, called the attribute modifier.

The four core attributes and their abbreviations are _Might (MI)_, _Agility (AG)_, _Wit (WI)_, and _Charm (CH)_.

_Might_ is a measurement of how strong your character is. A character with more _Might_ will be able to carry more, hit harder when fighting, and endure more hits.

_Agility_ is a measurement of how fast and flexible your character is. A character with more _Agility_ can run faster, climb more easily, and dodge attacks better.

_Wit_ is a measurement of your character’s intelligence. A character with more _Wit_ is able to identify plants and animals, is more likely to notice hidden details or traps, and is better at solving puzzles.

_Charm_ is a measurement of how well your character understands other people. A character with more _Charm_ is better at inspiring their allies, is more likely to notice when someone is hiding something, and is better at disguising themselves.

### Making an Attribute Check

If the Storyteller asks you to make an "Attribute Check," you'll roll 2 dice, add their values together, then add your attribute modifier. For example, if a character has a _Wit_ modifier of **+3** and the Storyteller asks them to make a _Wit_ check to see if they notice a trap, they would roll 2 dice, add them together, then add their _Wit_ modifier. If they roll a **2** and a **5**, the total value for their check would be **10**.

## Skills

Each attribute has a set of associated skills. Skills are more specific than attributes, and will only apply in certain situations. The more your character uses an skill, the more practiced they become with it, giving better and more consistent results. This is called the skill level.

### _Might_ Skills

The skills associated with _Might_ are _Haul_ and _Demolish_.

The _Haul_ skill is used to move heavy objects, push obstacles out of the way, or carry a wounded ally to safety.

The _Demolish_ skill is used to break down barriers, damage vehicles, or collapse a tunnel behind you to secure an escape.

### _Agility_ Skills

The skills associated with _Agility_ are _Sneak_ and _Acrobatics_.

The _Sneak_ skill is used to move quietly and stealthily without being noticed.

The _Acrobatics_ skill is used for climbing, swinging from vines or lines on a ship, and other such feats worthy of the Florid Sword.

### _Wit_ Skills

The skills associated with _Wit_ are _Ponder_ and _Search_.

The _Ponder_ skill helps your character recall information from books they have read, or think through a puzzle or problem.

The _Search_ skill is used to find or detect things, such as traps, secret passages, or to find edible food or follow tracks in the wilderness.

### _Charm_ Skills

The skills associated with _Charm_ are _Perform_ and _Discern_.

The _Perform_ skill is used for any sort of performance, be it using a musical instrument, making a disguise more convincing, or giving a motivating speech.

The _Discern_ skill is used to determine someone else's motivations, or tell when someone is trying to hide something.

### Equipment Skills

In addition to the skills above, characters can gain skill levels for different tools or equipment they use. Each tool will show what attribute modifier it uses. For example, a bow is listed as _Bow (AG)_ to show that it uses _Agility_, while a whistleharp would be listed as _Whistleharp (CH)_ to show that it uses _Charm_.

### Making a Skill Check

Making an skill check is a lot like making an attribute check. The main difference is that, for each level you have in a skill, you get to roll one extra die, always keeping the highest two.

For example, if a character has a _Charm_ modifier of **+1**, and a _Perform_ skill level of **2**, they would roll 4 dice, when asked to make a _Perform_ check, the 2 base dice and 2 extra from his _Perform_ skill level. If they roll a **2**, a **6**, a **2**, and a **4**, they would take the 2 highest values, the **4** and the **6**, and adds their _Charm_ modifier for a total of **11**, a rousing performance!

## Abilities

```()
This section is a work in progress
The goal for abilities is to be somewhat like feats in D&D. They will primarily be new actions that the character can take, using their existing skills and attributes.
Some abilities will require the character to be focusing on a specific T.H.A.G.
Each Background will also provide an Ability.
```

## T.H.A.G.S

[This section is a work in progress]  
Each character has a T.H.A.G that they specialize in, either Word, Form, or Song. Throughout their adventure, the character will gain new abilities depending on which T.H.A.G they chose.

### Word

Characters focusing on Word gain **+1** _Wit_, as well as a journal and set of writing utensils. They gain **1** level in the _Ponder_ skill.

### Form

Characters focusing on Form gain **+1** _Agility_, as well as a set of drawing utensils. They gain **1** level in the _Search_ skill.

### Song

Characters focusing on Song gain **+1** _Charm_, as well as a musical instrument of their choice. They gain **1** level in the _Perform_ skill.

## Backgrounds

Each character has a background that describes what their life was like before they started this adventure. Players can pick a background from the list in "Creating your Character", or work with the storyteller to create a custom background for your character. Each background includes bonuses to certain Attributes and Skills, as well as Abilities that are unique to characters with that background.

### Friends and Foes

Depending on what background your character has, they may get along more naturally with different people they meet. For example, someone with the Bookbindery Guild background will get along with librarians and book collectors, while someone with the Strander background is able to get along with other Stranders.

### Training

Each background comes with different training that will increase some of your attribute modifiers and skill levels. Each background will provide **+2** to one attribute, **+1** to another attribute, **2** levels in one skill, and **1** level in two other skills. Each background also comes with one ability.

### Equipment

Each background provides starting equipment for the character, as well as **2** skill levels for a tool or weapon. For example, the Strander background provides a pair of _Daggers (AG)_, and **2** skill levels when using those daggers, while the Houndry Guild background provides a _Dog Whistle (CH)_ and **2** skill levels when using the whistle.
